# Genetic Algorithm for Employee Timetabling Problem (ETP) solution

Application of an approximate genetic type algorithm (GA) developed during the production of an article as part of the evaluation of the discipline Algorithms and Data Structures - PPCA/UnB.

Solve the problem of the work schedule of the Socio-Educational Agents of an Inpatient Unit in the DF, in order to adapt and optimize the weekly workload of 40 hours, with lower cost and the need for adjustments.

### Requirements

The ideal number of Socio-Educational Agents per shift is 31 (thirty-one), whose current distribution is 28 servers in the modules;

Socio-educational agents work on a 24h x 72h scale (24 hours of work x 72 hours of rest);

At the end of the monthly cycle, the socio-educator must have completed and equivalent to 40 hours per week;

Each module must have at least 2 agents per shift;

At the end of the monthly cycle, the socio-educator must have completed and equivalent to 40 hours per week. Excessive or missing hours are controlled through workload adjustments in the following month;

Legal leave of absence of civil servants should be considered, examples: vacations, allowances, medical certificates, etc. Absences are of the type: working hours adjustment (ACH), allowance (AB) and Vacation.
